When I came back to College Station after this summer, my path for the next few months seemed fairly clear. Now, I'd argue that it's definitely not. Something that I didn't realize about the startup life is just how unpredictable it actually is. When I did Notequill with Graham, we worked on it often but over time it ended up being more of a project on the side rather than a full fledged startup. Now, I'm nearly ready to hop full time into a startup that I believe has an enormous opportunity for success.

These two things seemed similar in my mind during summer but now I can say that they are in completely different leagues. I think one of the major differences is that when I did Notequill, the path to my future was much more clear. While I was trying to put effort into the app, graduation from college was my primary focus (in retrospect). Thus, working on Notequill wasn't nearly as unclear because I knew that I would continue to work on school stuff in pursuance of my degree. Now, things are different.

Now that I'm graduated, I'm at a point where I can absolutely start doing something full time. Even though I've returned to school for a Master degree, I'm starting to see that the second degree might not be the best use of my time at this stage in my life. I have a huge opportunity to do something incredible at such a young age; why would I use my time doing something (a Masters degree) that I could do and finish later? I'm not going to let something so big slip right through my fingers.

Now, I'm stuck on this tightrope of wanting to go ahead and dive in to the startup but I'm held back by the fact that I'm taking two courses for my degree. In the back of my mind I know I can take them later and that makes me want to put them aside and make the startup my number one priority. Still, I've already paid for those courses so it would be a silly decision financially to drop the classes and jump into full time work. The correct course of action here really isn't hidden or confusing. I know that I should go ahead and finish the two classes that I started. Still, the fact that I have a choice to do something I love full time at this very moment is incredibly tempting. 

So I've got two courses that I'll be working on up until winter time. At the very same time, the startup is formulating other decisions about things like possible relocation and our future. This is the part that makes me a little anxious because there is some contention between the straightforward semester at school and the super volatile development plans of the startup. I know in the back of my mind that I just need to do my best at both and things will fall into place for the most part but my personality  conflicts slightly. The combination of the situation and my personality causes a little bit of stress.

Still though, I know that the only clear course of action for me is to do my best and put forth effort to go ahead and finish up the semester and help the startup progress as much as possible. The plan is simple when I put it in words. My minds tends to complicate things sometimes. When all is said and done though, I'm always able to look back and be proud of what I've achieved. That's true for any specific time period. I'm a do-er. Thus, why worry?

The truth is that I don't really know where I'm currently headed. I know that it's in the right direction, I just don't know the destination. That's okay; I don't need to know. My main priority is keeping the throttle down and continue working my butt off. The works pays off. That's a recurring plan and mindset that I have about things. It hasn't failed me in the past. I don't think it will fail me now either. 

Cowboy up.
