I has the pleasure of taking Artificial Intelligence this semester at Texas A&M with [Dr. Dylan Shell](http://robotics.cs.tamu.edu/dshell/ "Dr. Dylan Shell"). The course was overall very fun, and I greatly admire Dr. Shell for his teaching style. His lectures were both incredibly relevant and interesting. This was the type of course where you actually enjoy going to class because it's so interesting. 

As our final project, we were instructed to make some sort of information video about something we had learned over the course of the year that was related to Artificial Intelligence. The video could be almost any form and since I'm fairly good at writing music lyrics that rhyme, we decided to do a rap music video. The first step was to pick a suitable topic. We chose write the rap over the [Wumpus World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus "Wumpus World") because it was a fun way to learn about logical inference. Our second step was choosing a song to sing it to. We wanted to choose something that many people would know but wasn't incredibly new. After browsing various youtube videos for something that would work well, we found and decided to use Usher's "Yeah!"

For those unfamiliar, the Wumpus World is a game in which an "agent" (or character) is in a grid world and is in search of gold. In the world, there are pits and a creature called the Wumpus. The point of the game is to search for the gold and avoid falling in a pit or be eaten by the Wumpus. The agent does not know the location of anything initially, and must explore and map the grid. Each square has a set of precepts associated with it. A square with a breeze means that it adjoins a square with a pit, and a square with a stench means it adjoins a square with the Wumpus. The agent must use logical inference to explore the grid and avoid the dangers. Eventually, the agent should find the gold and may know where the Wumpus is based on inference. If the agent knows the location of the Wumpus, it can shoot an arrow in that direction and kill the Wumpus. By the end of the exploration, the agent should return to the entrance with the gold.

Our rap encompasses this game and helps to explain what the game is about in a comedic fashion. Since the Wumpus World was instrumental in our learning of logical inference, it was only natural to write a song about it and share it with the world. The video was written, performed, and edited by myself, Tyler Mandry, Josh Dover, and Keith Pattison. It's truly a masterpiece. So without further ado, here is our lovely video:
