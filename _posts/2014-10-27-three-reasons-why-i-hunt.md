title: Three Reasons Why I Hunt
category: life

Living in College Station, TX, I'm surrounded by a multitude of people that enjoy hunting. Whether the hunting preference be deer, waterfowl, birds, hogs, or a combination of the aforementioned, one does not regularly sit in a room full of people and not share the hobby of hunting with somebody else. While I might be considered a newbie hunter (only hunted since 2010), I enjoy the sport as much as anybody else. I would say that hunting is certainly a staple sport of the state of Texas.

Personally though, I don't consider hunting merely a sport. I feel like hunting trips are worth so much more than the physical act of shooting a weapon. Instead, the primary things I look forward to when I hunt are the comraderie and fellowship among the people I hunt with, the personal family interaction that I don't quite get anywhere else, and the competitive spirit we all embody while the hunting season is in session. Each of these things is something extra that I get out of hunting.

I love the comraderie and fellowship that each of the hunters on our lease shares with each other and that I personally share with everyone else. It's a great pleasure spending a weekend around each of the six others (which includes my brother who is present most weekends) that hunt on the same lease. While there will always be excitement sitting the the deer blind waiting for the trophy buck to emerge from the brush, the good times come more from the time spent around camp. Camp life is all about "hanging out with the guys" and generally just relax: we share stories, play washers, drink beer, sit around the fire, and enjoy football. I always look forward to days spent at the deer lease with everybody else because it gives me a reason to check out from everything else going on.

Moreover, I love spending this special time with my dad, brother, and step-grandfather that I don't get anywhere else. While nobody is explicitly against women being present, we usually equate hunting weekend with "guy time" and that's something I really enjoy. We give each other a hard time and talk about things that we wouldn't normally talk about in the presence of everybody else. It's not a secret, it's just "guy talk." This communication is fairly unique to times like these because these are special times in which I'm not surrounded by other family members or friends; it's simply us. I cherish that.

Lastly, hunting gives all of us a reason to be competitive with each other in a unique way: the only competitors are us and the competition is long lived. Each season, we compete to take the buck with the widest rack and with the most points. While this isn't any sort of new idea, it's fun to have a recurring competition that involves all of us every year. It's an additional topic that we all like to babble about back at camp.

These certainly aren't the only three reasons that I like to hunt though. These are just three additional reasons as to why I enjoy hunting so much. Hunting to me isn't just a sport. Hunting trips are a time that I get to spend time with the people I love and make unique memories together. I do and always will treasure all the moments spent.
