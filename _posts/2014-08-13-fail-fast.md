The biggest obstacle that prevents you from trying new things is yourself.

> A big part of learning is trying new things and failing fast. 

What does failing fast actually mean? For me, the definition means experimenting with new things and trying to implement interesting ideas. If those ideas or experiments end up not working, make sure you don't dwell on the failure but instead jump right back into other ideas and experiments. The result? Fast iteration and more innovation.

The phrase "fast iteration" probably means more to someone familiar with software development than it does to those who aren't but the basic idea is that you'd like to cut up large projects into much smaller pieces that can each be pushed to completion individually. This means that your work gets feedback more often and quicker. This also gives you the ability to "fail fast."

This is one of the big things that has allowed me to prosper at Google. I iterate on my work quickly and in turn I get more feedback earlier on in my development process. The significantly helps me build a bigger and better end product. In my opinion, this is one of the biggest things I did right during my internship. I'm not entirely done yet, but I've been able to say with confidence for quite some time that I am extremely proud of my accomplishments over the summer and how much I've developed as a person. One focused summer at a fantastic company can do absolute wonders.
