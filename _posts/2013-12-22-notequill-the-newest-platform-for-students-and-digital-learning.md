category: startups

[Graham Leslie](http://gleslie.com "Graham Leslie's Homepage") and I began building [Notequill](http://www.notequill.com "Notequill") in our spare time and eventually ended up with an incredible product that allowed for seamless web based note taking between all your devices. Our aim was to build a note editor that worked in all browsers and on all devices. For a long time we've been marketing our product to college students because we firmly believe that our application will make student's life easier. Being able to take notes and sketches in all your classes on any devices you've got with you is pretty fantastic.

Notequill is based in the cloud which makes the data accessible anywhere with internet and it encourages pure collaboration. Recently, we've discovered that our product could not only be the de facto standard in college classroom, but in high school and middle school classrooms as well. School district everywhere are implementing BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policies and allowing students to bring and use technology in the classroom. While the push for a more technologically classroom is great, many school are lacking a solid unified platform in which both students and instructors can collaborate. 

Notequill's architecture makes it the perfect candidate for use in the classroom. Our application works on any device and reuqires no installation. Any student can bring their device whether that be an iPad, an Android tablet, a phone, or a computer and be up and running ready to take notes immediately. We're creating tools that allow instructors to share notes, slides, books, and assignments with their students through Notequill. We truly are making the ultimate digital learning platform for the classroom. We've released a short explanatory video to demonstrate exactly what we're all about:
