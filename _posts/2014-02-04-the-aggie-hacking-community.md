Hacking has always been, in my opinion, one of the greatest ways to learn how to code. Hacking is all about writing code in quick iterations and bringing new ideas to life. Hacking isn't necessarily about writing code in the most efficient or effective way but rather creating something that works. Learning about coding academically in undergraduate classes can teach concepts but they often don't offer good opportunities to learn how to code creatively or quickly. Long before I was in college I learned to code by choosing projects that piqued my interest, developing working prototypes, and moving on. I was able to get answers to all my questions and develop code quickly through the use of online documentation, forums, and IRC chat rooms. 

After moving to College Station, TX, finding people with the hacker mentality was important to me. I wanted to find people who had great coding skills and enjoyed creating things they were interested in because I knew those people who would help me improve myself as a coder. Large companies often come to campus and host coding events and hackathons and while these types of events had the right kind of people, I always thought the events lacked good planning. Many events that I either attended or considered attending were held in small rooms and didn't let ideas flow. That's not the type of culture that I or others want coming to campus.

During my sophomore year I became an Entrepreneur in Residence at Startup Aggieland. I became friends with three members of 204 group (Joshua Dover, Tyler Mandry, and Keith Pattison) who had attempted to to create the community I was looking for. While their first event didn't fully meet there own expectations, they were all eager to begin organizing another event and I immediately jumped on the opportunity to help out. I had a completely different idea of hacker that the past events hadn't embraced and I knew I could help steer this event in the right direction.

###Enter aggieHack(web)

After some planning, it was decided that we would host a hackathon in the Fall of 2013 for all students. To effectively instill the idea of hacking into all our participants, we wanted to ensure that all of the criteria would be met:

1. Keep the hackathon broad so that people can be as creative as possible. Creativity and free flowing ideas are crucial components to a successful hackathon.
2. Keep the hackathon broad so that it stays attractive to a large number of students. Collaboration is yet another extremely important component of hacking.
3. Create a series of miniature challenges to introduce some competitiveness outside that of the main hackathon challenge.
4. Create a series of educational talks to encourage people that were new to hacking to come and learn about the culture and technologies.
5. Find a venue that offered substantial space for teams to form and execute ideas of their own.

In a matter of a few months we created some hype among students who were engrossed with the idea of a __real hackathon__. By this point our idea was completely validated and we immediately started ironing out all the specifics. We decided to host a 24 hour event in the Zachry building on campus. We designed four different "lightning" challenges that would take place throughout the night and numerous technical talks to explain all sorts of different technologies including General Web Development, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Git, and more. Our sponsors were eager to offer us prizes to give away to contestants and students were eager to come and embrace the culture that I hold dear.

By the end, we had a bunch of teams ready to demo their projects. All the projects turned out to be really neat, and it was clear that the contestants were ambitious in their ideas. I think it's intriguing to see other peoples creativity in action, and I was more than pleased to see so many successful teams. Overall, aggieHack(web) was a huge success and contestants were proud to tell everyone how much they had learned as well as how happy they were with the ability to have free reign to pursue a project they were interested in.

###HackerBowl

With the immense success of our first event and the successful development of our community, we decided to do it again and improve on our idea to expand the influence. We came up with the idea of a new annual event called [HackerBowl](http://www.hackerbowl.io "HackerBowl") -- the biggest hackathon in Texas A&M history. This school needs a bigger hacker culture and we firmly believe __this is one giant leap to bootstrap the process__. We're doing something brand spanking new and people love it.

New to hacking? Need guidance? Want to have an amazing time? [Sign up for Hackerbowl](http://hackerbowl.io/signup.html "HackerBowl Sign Up Page"). You won't be dissapointed.
