Howdy, I'm Brent. I'm a graduate student at Texas A&M University (Whoop!), a native Texan, a former class of '14 Fightin' Texas Aggie undergrad, a former Google intern, and a computer nerd. I'm currently working for a startup called [AskU](http://www.asku.co) doing full stack development. I love the web and the web loves me.

It isn't too hard to find me. If you want to know more about my professional background, check out my [LinkedIn](http://lnkd.in/HKK-dC), [Github](http://www.github.com/brentwalther), or [resume](http://brentwalther.net/files/resume.html).
