I started working at [Datatrak](http://www.datatrak.com/ "Datatrak") about a year ago and I've truly loved every moment of it. My office is incredibly convenient, I've learned a ton, and best of all, I've been fortunate enough to be surrounded by a ton of fantastic people. My coworkers and like engaging in a little healthy competition every once in a while, and we have done things from shortcode programming competitions to SEO competitions. While not related to our actual work, we all like engaging in something fun outside of the office.

### The beginnings
The idea of a SEO competition was originally produced by my coworker Corey Dulin. The instructions were simple: Given a phrase that has zero results on Google, get a page indexed on the search engine and claim the top result. After a little research, Corey decided that we would use the phrase "Cytokleptic Westerosi." By this point, I'm still not sure if the phrase has any true meaning other than a symbol for our competition. I think most everyone didn't think that we'd actually pursue an SEO competition but I acted quickly and put up a page on my personal website the day after Corey announce the phrase. Shortly after I generated a new sitemap to submit to Google and I was on the index within three days.

### The battle
Honestly, there wasn't very much battle. Since I was the first person to introduce the phrase to Google, it put me on some sort of pedestal. Corey put up an entry on his page the following week but it took him almost 6 months to finally pass me on the index. It was too easy for me, however. I simply made the initial page and then edited it only once during the 6 month time. One the other hand, Corey made a plethora of "Cytokleptic Westerosi" themed pages on Facebook, Twitter, and even Yahoo groups. He was desperate for back links but little did he know his efforts were futile.

Nonetheless, Corey kept on fighting. Aaron Gotreaux put up a page to enter the competition but had no real interest in actually winning. Meanwhile, Corey is inserting Google+ "+1" buttons on his page and even applied to be a business in Google's eyes to try and win that top spot. I sat with my glass of lemonade and basked in the glory of being the reigning champion. I eventually felt like I would have the top spot forever but out of nowhere Corey took the top spot. How did he get it? He classified his place of residence as a business called Cytokleptic Westerosi that specializes in web design and SEO. How ironic.

### The aftermath
The competition still isn't finished at this point, but I'm not incredibly sure if I want to continue to pursue it. Corey has achieved the top spot, and it might just stay that way. If anyone comes across this blog post and finds it interesting, I encourage you to submit your own entry. I still don't know what the phrase means, but it's a special inside joke between all of us. Who knows? You could be the next king of the hill.

### The new era
After a few weeks of waiting, it seems that I've once again obtained dominance. Even though Corey thinks he owns a business, my sheer Cytokleptic Westerosi power pushed through the hardships to come out on top once again. I am certain that my content is relevant to the phrase and is perhaps even the de facto standard. This battle has not totally been lost. I will continue to fight and I will continue to win.
